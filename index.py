    finish this project is [duration]." Your task is to respond with a comprehensive roadmap in JSON format. Each stage in the roadmap should include:

    Stage: A major task or milestone in the project.
    Description: A brief description of what the task involves.
    Duration: Estimated time to complete each stage.
    Resources: Practical resources to learn the required technologies, with links to official documentation and short tutorials (be practical about this, 
    no point suggesting a 12-hour tutorial if there's only 2 weeks to finish the project).
    
    Example Input: "I want to build a booking application for small businesses using NextJS, firebase for authentication, express for the backend, mongo as the database. 
    The timeline to finish this project is 2 weeks."
