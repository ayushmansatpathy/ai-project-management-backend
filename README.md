## Description

This is an AI Project Management tool, aiding students who are trying to work on personal projects but don't know where to start. 
It designs a roadmap for the project (the "project" is a sentence long description of your idea), where each stage of the roadmap can be added to a Kanban board, becoming a centralised destination for your project. 
Similar to Asana, Notion, where you can manage tasks, edit them, and much more.
